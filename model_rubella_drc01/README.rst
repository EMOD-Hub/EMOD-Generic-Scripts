model_rubella_drc01
===================

Simulations that produce Figure 5 in the manuscript "Examination of scenarios
introducing rubella vaccine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo." These
simulations do not include scheduled supplementary immunization activities and
are used to demonstrate the potential for increased congenital rubella syndrome
after vaccine introduction. See https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvacx.2021.100127

Important features include:

- Maternally derived immunity.
- Steady-state population pyramid.
- Very low rates of exogeneous importation.
- Posterior distribution of R0 values used as input.
