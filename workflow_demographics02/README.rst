This example demonstrates the implementation of vital dynamics (births, deaths,
and aging) to reproduce data from UN World Population Prospects between the
years 1950 and 2090. Simulations include no infections or contagion, and have
only one node.

Sweep outcomes are replicates of two time periods: estimates (1950 - 2020) and
median projections (2020 - 2090). Simulations do not currently include any
immigration, so it is not possible to match WPP data for countries where total
population would be declining except for an exogeneous source of adult
individuals.
