Important features include:

- Multi-node network used to represent regions of Nigeria at the 10km scale.
- Network infectivity contagion transfer between nodes.
- Spatially varying rates of routine immunization.
- Acquisition-transmission covariance.
- Pre-specified calendar of supplemental immunization activities (SIAs).
- Maternally derived immunity.
- Overdispersion of the infection rate.
- Maximum simulation duration based on elapsed time.
- Weighted agents to represent multiple individuals per agent.
- Age-based immunity initialization to approximate endemic transmission.
- Infectivity reservoir to represent persistent exogeneous importation.
